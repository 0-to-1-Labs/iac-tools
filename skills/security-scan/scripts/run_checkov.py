run_checkov.py — the Checkov adapter for iac-tools (WS-2).

Invoke Checkov, normalize its output into the SPEC §5 finding shape, and
ISOLATE it. This is the ONLY file in the codebase that is allowed to know
what Checkov's JSON looks like (SPEC §14.1 risk #1): swapping in tfsec or
Trivy must remain a one-file change, so no Checkov-native field name
(`check_id`, `file_line_range`, `resource`, ...) may leak past this module.

Key behaviors:
  * Captures BOTH failed_checks and passed_checks. The passing set is what
    §7.2's "controls SATISFIED by the current IaC" is derived from, and it is
    the reason we do NOT pass Checkov's `--quiet` flag (which silently drops
    passed_checks from the JSON).
  * Normalizes Checkov's `/athena.tf` (leading slash, relative to scan root)
    to the repo-relative `athena.tf` that the WS-1 parser emits. The downstream
    join key is (normalized-rule-concept, file, resourceAddress); a silent
    mismatch here breaks EVERY join and yields a scan that finds nothing while
    looking perfectly healthy.
  * Emits severity as null, always. Checkov community edition does not populate
    severity (it is a Bridgecrew/Prisma paid feature). We do not invent one and
    we do not default to medium — WS-3's data/rule-severity.json owns that.
  * Records the Checkov version it ran (`checkovVersion`) next to the version
    the seeds were graded against (`gradedVersion`), and lists every failing
    rule that has no severity seed (`unseededRules`) as a stderr WARNING and a
    payload field. requirements.txt is a floor, so a newer Checkov may add
    rules; those must surface visibly, never crash and never vanish.
  * If Checkov is absent: LOUD degradation. Print the `pip install checkov`
    line to stderr, set degraded=true in the output, and continue so the caller
    can run the LLM-only path. A scan that found nothing because the tool was
    missing must never look like a scan that found nothing because the code was
    clean.

Usage:
    python3 run_checkov.py <path> [--framework terraform]

Emits JSON on stdout. Exit codes: 0 ok (including "degraded"), 2 scan error.
