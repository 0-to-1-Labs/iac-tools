"""Report rendering -- Markdown + JSON (WS-7, SPEC §9.1).

The section order is a design decision, not a style preference. A user must be
able to stop reading at any point and still have acted correctly:

  1. Verdict            -- one line
  2. Quick wins         -- high impact, simple fix, diffs inline
  3. Findings by priority
  4. Not fixable in IaC -- CLI command / console steps (§6.4)
  5. Compliance coverage -- only with --compliance (Phase 2; seam only)
  6. Degradation & scan integrity

Two rules this module exists to enforce
---------------------------------------

**A scan that found nothing because it could not read the files must never look
like a scan that found nothing because the files were clean.** So degradation is
not a footnote: it is stamped on the verdict line itself (section 1, the one line
everybody reads) *and* expanded in section 6. ``render_markdown`` on a degraded
scan cannot produce output that reads clean -- see ``tests/test_report.py``.

**A finding you cannot patch is not a finding you hide.** Non-IaC findings are
ranked with everything else in section 3 and given their `aws` command or console
steps in section 4.

remediationComplexity, and why quick wins would otherwise be empty
-----------------------------------------------------------------
``Finding.remediationComplexity`` defaults to ``moderate`` and ``is_quick_win``
requires ``simple``, so a merge with no LLM enrichment yields **zero** quick wins
-- the section people actually act on would be permanently empty on any scan that
did not pay for an Opus pass. That is a bug in the pipeline, not a reason to
lower the bar.

The fix is ``derive_complexity``: if the *deterministic* fix catalog (WS-5)
generated a patch for this finding and **every change in it is additive**
(``type == "add"`` -- a new attribute, a new block, a new companion resource;
nothing existing overridden, nothing removed), then the fix is mechanically
simple by construction. The diff is already written, it applies cleanly, and
Checkov re-passes on it. There is no judgment call, because nothing the author
wrote is being second-guessed. That is what ``simple`` means.

It is a *floor*, never a ceiling, and never a downgrade:
  - only promotes ``moderate`` (the default) -> ``simple``;
  - never touches a finding an LLM explicitly rated ``complex``;
  - records ``remediationComplexitySource: "fix-catalog"`` so the promotion is
    auditable and an enrichment pass can overrule it.

A patch that *modifies* an existing value (``replace_block``, an attribute the
author already set) is NOT promoted: overriding a deliberate choice is exactly
the judgment call ``simple`` promises there isn't one of.
