"""
Baseline, suppression, and PR-diff-only scoping (WS-15, Phase 4).

Three ways to run this scanner against a *real* repo over time instead of a
one-shot audit. All three are **filters over the merged finding set** plus a
scope summary that the report shows out loud -- nothing here ever *drops* a
finding silently. A finding that this module removes from the report is always
counted, and the count is rendered where a human will see it.

    1. Baseline  -- accept the pre-existing backlog so a scan reports only what
       is NEW since a checked-in snapshot. This is what makes the tool adoptable
       on a repo that starts with 200 findings.

    2. Suppression -- a per-finding, reviewed, *reasoned* acceptance. We honor
       Checkov's own native ``#checkov:skip=<ID>:<reason>`` mechanism (the reason
       lands in ``check_result.suppress_comment``) and, as a parallel escape
       hatch for LLM-only findings that Checkov never saw, an
       ``.iac-tools-ignore`` file keyed by finding id + reason. A
       suppression with **no reason is rejected** -- an accepted risk with no
       stated reason is not accepted, it is hidden.

    3. Diff-only -- scope the report to the files changed in this branch vs a
       base ref, so the tool is a fast PR gate instead of a whole-repo scan on
       every push. The base branch is *verified*, never assumed to be ``main``.

Reuse, not reinvention: finding identity comes from ``findings.py``
(``generate_finding_id`` -> ``sha256(ruleId:file:resourceAddress)``); the
finding shape is exactly what ``merge_findings.merge`` emits; path normalization
matches ``run_checkov.normalize_path`` so the diff join lands on the same strings
the finding locations use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Design note: id-matching and the fixed-then-reintroduced case
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A baseline matches on the STABLE finding id -- ``sha256(ruleId:file:address)`` --
NOT on line numbers. That is deliberate and is the whole point: reformatting a
file or shifting a resource down 40 lines must not resurface a finding a team
already consciously accepted. Adding a genuinely NEW insecure resource changes
the address (or the file), so it produces a new id and correctly surfaces.

The honest consequence, which we do not paper over: a finding that is baselined,
then *fixed*, then later *reintroduced at the same address* produces the same id
again and would be re-suppressed by a stale baseline. A stateless, checked-in
"accepted debt" file cannot by itself tell "still the old debt" from "the same
mistake, made again" -- both are byte-identical identities. There is no history
in the file to distinguish them.

The resolution is workflow, and we make it explicit rather than hide the gap:
the baseline is a living, checked-in artifact. When a finding is fixed, the team
regenerates the baseline (``--write-baseline``), which drops the now-absent
finding from it; a later reintroduction then has no baseline entry and surfaces
as new risk. ``apply_baseline`` therefore also reports ``stale`` entries --
baselined ids that did NOT appear in the current scan -- precisely so a fixed
finding is visible as "safe to prune from the baseline," which keeps the file
honest and makes the reintroduction case behave correctly on the next cycle.
