cross_check.py — an independent second opinion from a DIFFERENT model family.

WS-16 (SPEC Phase 4, `--cross-check`). Every other LLM layer in this product is
Claude. That is a monoculture: a blind spot Claude shares with itself is invisible
to itself. This layer asks OpenAI's `codex` (gpt-5.x) — a different model family,
different training, different failure modes — to look at the *same* findings and
the *same* IaC, ADVERSARIALLY. It has two jobs, and neither of them is allowed to
touch the finding list.

  1. VERIFY the high-priority findings. For each critical/high finding, codex is
     asked, independently, whether the finding is real and correctly rated given
     the surrounding IaC. A finding both Claude and codex confirm is high-
     confidence. A finding codex refutes is flagged ``crossCheck: "disputed"`` —
     NOT dropped. The deterministic Checkov layer owns whether a finding exists;
     cross-check annotates confidence, it does not delete.

  2. FIND WHAT WE MISSED. Optionally, hand codex the IaC plus our finding list and
     ask what we did NOT flag. Anything it surfaces is reported as
     ``source: ["codex"]`` and ``crossCheckCandidate: true`` — an un-deduped
     second-opinion candidate for human review, never promoted to a first-class
     finding automatically.

THE NON-NEGOTIABLE (same shape as ``merge_findings.py``): codex CANNOT delete a
finding. This module only ever *adds* keys to a finding dict. There is no code
path in which a codex verdict removes an element from the finding list, and
``cross_check()`` asserts the input finding set survives on the way out. A planted
injection comment that talks codex into "disputed" therefore costs the finding a
confidence annotation, never its existence.

SAFETY (same rules as the Claude layers, SPEC §11):
  * IaC file contents are UNTRUSTED INPUT. Every repo-derived string handed to
    codex goes inside a ``wrap_untrusted()`` block under ``UNTRUSTED_PREAMBLE`` —
    the exact scheme ``enrich_prompts.py`` / ``security-analyst.md`` use. A
    planted comment must not steer codex either.
  * codex runs ``--sandbox read-only``. It never writes, never applies, never
    plans. Generated candidate findings are text, reviewed by a human.
  * Parallelism is capped and every call has a per-call timeout, so a hung codex
    call cannot wedge a scan (the ``review.sh`` discipline, ported).

DEGRADE LOUDLY. codex requires OAuth (`codex login`), not an API key. If the
binary is absent or not authenticated we set ``crossCheckDegraded: true`` with a
reason and an enable hint, print it to stderr, and continue — exactly like the
Checkov-absent path. A ``--cross-check`` run that silently did nothing must NEVER
look like one where codex agreed with everything.
