# hooks/, the opt-in `terraform apply` security gate

This directory ships a PreToolUse hook that can gate `terraform apply` on unfixed
security findings. **It is disabled by default and does nothing until you turn it on.**
Two design rules make it safe to ship at all:

1. **Installing the plugin arms nothing.** The hook is *not* wired in
   `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, and there is deliberately **no** `hooks/hooks.json`
   (Claude Code auto-loads that file, which would arm the gate on install). The
   registration snippet ships as `hooks.json.example`, which is never loaded.

2. **It never auto-approves.** The hook answers `ask` or `deny`, never `allow`. If
   Checkov is missing, the scan errors or times out, the command cannot be parsed, or
   the hook itself throws, you get your normal permission prompt with the gate's
   verdict attached, never a wedged deploy, and never a pre-approved one. The `deny`
   path is reachable only when a scan actually ran and actually found a blocking
   finding in `block` mode.

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apply_gate.py` | The hook. Deterministic Checkov scan of the target dir, seeded severities, decision per mode. |
| `hooks.json.example` | The registration snippet in plugin hooks-file shape. Never loaded; copy it into your `.claude/settings.json`. |
| `iac-tools.local.md.example` | Template for the per-project enable flag. Copy to `.claude/iac-tools.local.md`. |

## Enable (two independent gates, both off by default)

**Step 1, register** the hook (this only makes it *run*, not *block*). Put the
`hooks` block into your project's `.claude/settings.json` with an absolute path to the
installed plugin (`claude plugin details iac-tools@0-to-1-labs` prints it).
The top-level `hooks` key is required; without it nothing is registered.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "python3 \"/absolute/path/to/iac-tools/hooks/apply_gate.py\"",
            "timeout": 150
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

`hooks.json.example` shows the same block with `"${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}"`, which only
resolves inside a plugin's own hooks file. Do not copy files into the installed plugin
directory: it is replaced on every plugin update. Confirm the registration with
`/hooks` after restarting Claude Code.

**Step 2, flip the flag** by creating `.claude/iac-tools.local.md` at the
project root:

```markdown
---
apply_gate: block            # off (default) | warn | ask | block
apply_gate_severity: critical  # critical | high | medium | low
apply_gate_timeout: 120        # seconds; scan is bounded, a timeout -> ask
---
```

Until this file sets a mode other than `off`, `apply_gate.py`'s first action is to
no-op. The file is looked up under `$CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` (the project root Claude Code
exports to hooks) first, then under the session's working directory, so a `cd` into a
subdirectory does not switch the gate off. Environment variables override the file
(useful in CI): `IAC_TOOLS_APPLY_GATE`, `IAC_TOOLS_APPLY_GATE_SEVERITY`,
`IAC_TOOLS_APPLY_GATE_TIMEOUT`.

## Modes

- `off`, disabled (default). Instant no-op.
- `warn`, ask, with a loud warning listing the findings in the prompt.
- `ask`, ask you to confirm before applying, findings listed.
- `block`, deny the apply, listing the findings and how to bypass (fix, or set
  `apply_gate: off`).

A clean scan is `ask` in every mode: the gate does not pre-approve.

## Scope & bounds

Gated: `terraform apply`, `tofu apply`, `terragrunt apply` / `terragrunt run-all apply`,
including behind `env`, `time`, `sudo`, `sh -c '...'`, with `-chdir=DIR`, and after a
`cd DIR` earlier in the same command line (the scan follows the `cd`). A command that
mentions an apply but hides it behind `$(...)`, backticks, a `$VAR`, or `eval` cannot be
parsed and resolves to `ask`. Every other Bash command passes through untouched. The
scan is deterministic (Checkov + the checked-in `data/rule-severity.json` seed, no LLM,
no network) and runs against the **target directory only**, with a hard timeout.
Findings whose seeded severity is `unmapped` never gate an apply, we don't block on a
severity we didn't review.

Hook changes require restarting Claude Code (`/hooks` shows what's loaded).
